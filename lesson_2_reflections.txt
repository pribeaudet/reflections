## First Question: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

ANSWER: WHen you initialize a reporsitory, you create a hidden repository called .git that keeps track of all the repository history (the logs that are displayed when you hit the command git log). You need to do it to be able to keep track of all the future changes you'll do in that repository.

## Second question: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

ANSWER:  Staging area let's you select the files you want to commit from the working directory, so when you commit you don't have to add all of them. It helps to keep the commmits subject related.


### Third question: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

ANSWER: You can add to staging files that belong to the same logical change, and then commit those together, as well as adding a message that clearly summarizes the commit your doing. 


### Forth question: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

ANSWER: By creating a branch, you can experiment new code without messing around with your current working code. If you brake something, just checkout to master (or the latest commit) and you're safe again. It helps to keep histpry organized because you don't directly change it.


### Fifth question: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

ANSWER: It helps to understand what the master branch is and how the other subsequent branches relate to it, also how the commits are structured to keep the past of the branch where it was commited.


### Sixth question: What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

ANSWER: Merging 2 branches together keeps the history of the master branch and adds on the new code that was tested and validated in the new branch. It is represented in the diagram the way it was to illustrate that many people can work on different branches at the same time, and then merge it all to master.


### Seventh question: What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

ANSWER: Pros: In the automatic, it points out the conflicts so you can choose what to keep/delete. Same goes for manual.
Cons: It requires some time and analysis to figure out code modification, ans some asking around as well.
