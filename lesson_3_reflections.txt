## First question: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

ANSWER: When other people will collaborate to that repo. Also, it's a safe backup for your code, not trusting that everything wil lbe hosted only in your machine.

### Second question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

ANSWER: Because if it's a shared repo, people may commit stuff and it will automatically be pulled to your machine, inserting modifications that you don't want. This will get out of hand. 
By pulling manually, you will know the right moment when what's n github has to be merged to what you have on your local.
